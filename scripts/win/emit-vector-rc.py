#
# This python script auto-generates the files
#
#   src/common/scalableresource.h and
#   src/windows/scalableui.rc
#
# which are included by resource.h and surge.rc
# respectively. It creates those files such that
# the IDs for the scalable assets in original-vector
# are correctly ejected and refer to the correct assets
# such that IDB_BG for the 300% image is IDB_BG + SCALABLE_300_OFFSET
# or altnerately IDB_BG_SCALE_300. Both names are needed
# (alas) because .rc files cannot support identifiers which are
# operations. So we need to have an explicit define of
# a variable which has the value of the addition (which is
# what is in the scalableresource.h) and have that be consistent
# with the images and resource file definition.
#
# I chose to run this infrequently and commit the auto-generated
# output rather than run it at build time for several reasons
#
# * These files change very infrequently. In the entire surge development
#   cycle from september to january 2019 there has been only one addition
#   to the IDB list
# * Adding python as a dependency at build time is a burden on our
#   less experienced users
# * Plenty of precedent for checking in well documented generated code
#   in the audio community (juce does it).
#
# Conditions under which you need to re-run this script are
#
# * You add a bitmap
# * You change the values of the SCALABLE_ constants in resource.h
# * You add a resolution
#
# Since each of those require a commit, the committed output is also
# consistent.
#
# Finally the script is named 'emit-' rather than 'build-' or 'make-'
# to avoid tab completion finding this instead of build-win.ps1
