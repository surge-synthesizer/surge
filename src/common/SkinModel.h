/*
 * # SKIN MODEL / SKIN / PARAMETER / SURGEGUIEDITOR COLLABORATION
 *
 * This is the developer documentation on the core architecture of the skinning and
 * UI engine in surge.
 *
 * The Surge UI comprises two things
 * - Items bound to a parameter. Pitch slider, say.
 * - Control items which do something. Oscillator Selector, say
 *
 * Each of these elements has some visual control with a callback
 * handler to do its action; and each is bound to a well named
 * control concept or parameter.
 *
 * Moreover, we want Surge UI to have a reasonable default compiled in,
 * and we want that default to be completely over-rideable in our VSTGUI
 * implementation.
 *
 * And finally, we don't want the core of surge to refernce VSTGUI.
 *
 * So that gets us the following set of collaborations
 *
 * Parameter: A parameter exposed as a DAW parameter with a name, value, type.
 *            This is a logical concept consumed by the DSP algos and so on
 * Connector: A connector is the expression of a default layout and control
 *            type. It has a UID, size, type, and other properties. See
 *            below for why this is not in src/common/gui. Most importantly
 *            the parameter is either declared as a global with a NonParameter
 *            connector type - which means it is an unbound control - or
 *            it is declared as a global and consumed in the constructor of Parameter
 * Skin: In src/common/gui. Skin maps a union of the Connectors and an XML document
 *       to give a runtime representation of the UI. It contains functions like
 *       "give me a renderable component by id". If the skin document is empty
 *       there is no difference content wise between a Surge::UI::Skin::Control
 *        and a Surge::Skin::Connector; but the Connector is just the starting
 *        point for XML parse so skins can override it
 * SurgeGUIEditor: As well as callbacks, SGE is now basically a loop over the skin
 *                 data structure connecting things.
 *
 * SO why is this in src/common and not src/common/gui?
 *
 * Well the reason is that surge lays out its UI by parameter. Basically it's
 * a renderer where parameters attach to UI components. That happens at parameter
 * creation time in SurgePatch (now) and that's a logical place to give something a
 * UI 'name'.
 *
 * This acts as the symbols for the UI names and those symbols carry reasonable
 * defaults for class and position which the skin engine can override.
 *
 * So our two choices were
 * 1. Have a collection of symbols without an UI information here and augment it
 *    separately with positions in src/common/gui or
 * 2. Have the data (but not the renderer) for the layout information in src/common
 *
 * I chose #2 mostly because #1 is especially tedious since a collection of parameters
 * share a skin identity. For instance, all of the oscilator pitch sliders (of which there
 * are 6 as of 1.8.0) are a single point of skin identity. Thus attaching them to skin
 * data models in SurgePatch makes sense.
 *
 * And I took comfort that this data is completely free of any rendering code. Nothing
 * here links or requires vstgui etc... This is pure data about naming (via skin ids
 * and object namespaces) and defaults.
