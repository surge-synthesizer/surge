/*
 * There are a number of places in Surge where raw C strings are copied around.
 * Ideally these would be replaced with something safer, but for the time being, a replacement
 * for dangerous strcpy operations at least was needed.
 *
 * strncpy is no good - the destination buffer can end up being non-NULL-terminated, and it also
 * writes zeros the length of the whole buffer for no reason.
 * bsd strlcpy is also no good, it performs a length check on the source string for no reason.
 *
 * So, here's strxcpy:
 * a function that copies a string to dst from src
 * while ensuring that dst does not exceed n bytes
 *
 * that's it. it returns nothing.
 * that suits Surge's purposes fine, as we don't care if a string gets truncated, only that we
 * don't crash.
 *
 * the current implementation just uses snprintf.

/*
 * There are also a whole mess of 'txt' buffers scattered through the code - sometimes different
 * lengths. For now, standardize on 256 bytes to get rid of the magic constants.
 *
 * If something breaks - check the TXT_SIZE constants versus what they were in earlier revisions!
 *
 * In some cases, buffers that were not called txt but served a similar purpose and were also 256
 * bytes now also use this constant.
