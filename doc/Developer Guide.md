# Developer Guide

## Introduction

This document contains the guidelines that we use in Surge development. Please
follow them whenever possible. If you have further questions look at README.md
for an up to date list of Surge communication channels.

## Contributing

### Code reviews

Code reviews are important parts of pull requests. Folks do them carefully and
seriously. But we always are polite and professional. If you think a comment about
your code is somehow rude or impolite, please don't; noone in the surge community has that 
intent.

But please do expect your code to be reviewed before it is merged, and you may be asked
to make changes. Skewing to these rules nad checking them before you do a PR can help 
make everyones time more efficient.

### Commit messages

Format:

```
<short summary one-line summary>

<long description describing the change in detail:

<optional tag>
```

A tag can be either `Related: <issue>` or `Closes: <issue>`.


### Github usage

* The [git-howto](git-howto.md) is a good basic if you are newer to git.
* Generally, try and have a github issue which documents what you are trying to do
* Name your branch with a descriptive name and an isssue number. For isntance
`mac-wav-file-198` is a branch to implement wav file reading on mac in response to issue
198
* Try to have pull requests have one or a small number of commits. If your change has two
logical big steps, two commits is fine, but work commits where you just make a small change
could be squashed with `git rebase`. If you don't know how to do this, ask on slack or 
put in the PR with your commits and we can squash at merge
* Try to avoid trivial or unrelated diffs. Your diffs should be "about" the same size as your
change.

## Coding style

### Basics

* Obey the 'campground rule' that code you change should get better. Cleaner, better names,
better indents, more comments.
* But at the same time obey the 'small change' rule, which is most of the time the smallest
change is the best change. So editing a function with a variable name you don't love is OK
if that variable name is in 30 other places.
* Use spaces, not tabs
* The code is mostly formatted with 3 space tab width, which is odd. If you are in a 3-space
section stick to 3 spaces. If you are writing new code we are OK with 3 or 4. But code should align

### Naming

* `#defined` constants are `UPPERCASE_VARIABLES`
* `class HaveCamelcaseNames`
* `void functionsAreCamelCaseWithLowerFirst`
* We are not using `s_` or `m_` or equivalent notations for members or statics
* Full namespaces are generally prefered over usings. We are trying to use
`std::vector` over `vector` in the code. 
* Don't `using namespace` in header files. Don't `using namespace std` in new code (but it is in some existing code).
* Use namespaces not classes to group functions. Check out how we implemented `UserInteractions.h`
* Long and descriptive names are good. `userMessageDeliveryPipe` is better than `umdp`. 

### Comments

Comments for declarations of member functions or free functions aspires to javadoc/doxygen style.

```
class Example
{
    /**
     * replace the printer
     * @param printerName which printer to replace
     *
     * Replace the printer 
     */
    void replacePrinter(std::string printerName);
}
```

Comments for bigger chunks of code inline use a multiline comment

```
   ...
   x = 3 + y;
   
   /*
   ** Now we have to implement the nasty search
   ** across the entire set of the maps of sets
   ** and there is no natural index, so use this
   ** full loop
   */
   for (auto q ...
```

Use single line comments sparingly, but where appropriate, feel free.

Generally: Comment your code. Someone coming after you will thank you. And that someone may be you!

### Format your code properly with clang-format

Surge ships with a `.clang-format` file which makes choices about how to format code. You can
use this to make sure your diffs are formatted properly. Here's how

* install `clang-format` and `git-clang-format`. On macOS this can be done with
  `brew install clang-format`. On linux and windows it is left as an exercise to the reader.
  If you complete that exercise, please update this doc!
* Develop and so on as you normally would following the prescription in our
  [git howto](git-howto.md)
* Format the code at one of two development points:
  * Before you commit but after you add, do a `git clang-format` and it will correct your code
  * Add a series of commits on your branch (because you are on branch of course to develop)
    then at the very end, `git clang-format master` will reformat all your changes from master.
    Commit and squash that commit.


### Miscellany

Occasionally code needs an `#if MAC` but if you have entire classes with parallel implementations
just put the implementations in the `src/mac` `src/windows` and `src/linux` directories and
let cmake pick the right one. This does mean that you need stubs on all three platforms to link.
Look at the `UserInteractions` example.

The only numbers which make sense in code are 0, 1, n, and infinity. If you are using a number other
than that, perhaps toss in a comment.

Prefer `std::ostringstream` and so on to `sprintf` and so on.

`#pragma once`, while not [really standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragma_once), is used in 
most of the code, so we are continuing to use it rather than ifdef guards.

## Tips for developing on particular platforms

First and foremost: Do what works for you. These are just some collected tips from those
of us who have been working on surge. They may or may not work for you. If you have good 
ideas to help developers, please add em here!

### Macintosh

The easiest way to debug on macintosh that @baconpaul found is to make it so you
can run the plugin in a host and see stdout.

To use the AU in Logic, Mainstage, GarageBand, and so on, the very first time you need to
do one more one-time step which is to invalidate your AU cache so that you force Logic to rescan.
The easiest way to do this is to move the AudioUnitCache away from it's location by typing in:

```
mv ~/Library/Caches/AudioUnitCache ~/Desktop
```

For the AU Host, the easiest way to do this is with [Hosting AU](http://ju-x.com/hostingau.html).
Install it and set up a single track containing a surge instance. Save that Hosting AU
configuration as (say) `~/Desktop/Surge.hosting` then run:

```
/Applications/Hosting\ AU.app/Contents/MacOS/Hosting\ AU ~/Desktop/Surge.hosting
```

You can route midi to that, play it with the keyboard using Hosting AU keyboard driver, and so on.

You can similarly capture stdout from logic (or other programs) by running the appropriate command
for the inside of the app from terminal. For instance `/Applications/Logic\ Pro\ X.app/Contents/MacOS/Logic\ Pro\ X ` will run 
Logic and show you stdout.

For VST2, [carla](https://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Carla) provides a super light weight VST2 wraparound. 
I just unpacked it into `~/Desktop/Carla`. You also need to install jack so:

```
brew install jack
jackd -d coreaudio
```

and then after a build you can load the VST2 into a single host with 

```
~/Desktop/Carla/carla.lv2/carla-bridge-native vst2 products/Surge.vst/ 'none' '(0)'
```

Finally, bitwig is an excellent host for development since you don't have to restart
it between builds. stdout goes to the logs in ~/Library/Logs/Bitwig

Profiling on macOS is awesome too! Start the synth doing something then

```
instruments -l 30000 -t Time\ Profiler -p pid
```

and look at the output with open.

### Linux

You can get a very clean debugging environment using Carla and surge where you can
play notes on an onscreen keyboard and route them to the VST2 with stdout visible.
Everything here is documented for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Different packages have different
things of course.

To do that you first need to install a bunch of jack code.

```
sudo apt-get install jack
sudo apt-get install jack-keyboard
sudo apt-get install ajmidid
```

Then run `jac` and `ajmidid` in separate terminals

```
jackd -d alsa -X alsa_midi
a2jmidid -e
```

Now start surge with carla-single

```
~/Carla_2.0-RC3-linux64/carla/carla-bridge-native vst2 ./target/vst2/Release/Surge.so  '(none)' '0'
```

and then in a fourth keyboard start `jack-keyboard`. The connect-to option should have
Surge as an endpoint. Pick it and you can play the GUI keyboard and hear and watch the
stdout go by.

To run valgrind:

```
./build-linux.sh build --project=headless
valgrind --leak-check=yes build/surge-headless
```

and remember

```
#include <valgrind/memcheck.h>
#include <iostream>
 
...

  int notDef;
  if( auto v = VALGRIND_CHECK_MEM_IS_DEFINED(notDef) )
    std::cout << "Memory notDef is not defined at " << v << std::cout
```
