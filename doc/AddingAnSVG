# Adding an SVG to the Resources Bundle

We have some 'well named' SVGs which compile into the bundle. These are all in
assets/SurgeClassic/exported. What happens if you want to add one?

1. Add the ID to the IDB_ in resource.h. 
2. add the addEntry in SurgeBitmaps.cpp. You are now done for mac and linux actually!
3. Add the IDB_BLAH_SVG_DATA in svgresources.rc
4. Add the IDB_MENU_IN_SLIDER_SCALE_BLAH defines to scalableresource.h
