This is your Surge-XT User Area

With Surge-XT, we are using a more structured user area which
separates the storage of patches, wavetables, FX settings,
MIDI settings, and Modulator Settings. Each of these types of
assets now has a parent level directory.

Most importantly, you can read the surge manual at

https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/

but if you want to import patches, drag them into the Patches
directory, and so on.

Before we release XT we will also add some sort of rudimentary
migration assistant. Until then you are kinda on your own.
Hope on discord if you get stuck during the alpha / early beta stage.
