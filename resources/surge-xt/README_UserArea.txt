This is your Surge XT user area!

With Surge XT, we are using a more structured user area which
separates the storage of patches, wavetables, FX settings,
MIDI settings, and modulator settings. Each of these types of
assets now have a parent level directory.

Most importantly, you can read the Surge manual at:

https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/

but if you want to import patches, drag them into the Patches
directory, and so on.

Before we release Surge XT, we will also add some sort of rudimentary
migration assistant. Until then, you are kinda on your own.
Hop on Discord if you get stuck during the alpha and early beta stage!
