## SurgeXT Nightly Release

This is the nightly release of SurgeXT. Surge nightlies are usually quite stable, but they may contain bugs or incomplete features. Please use caution running this beta software.

We have a draft of our changelog available [here](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/nightlychangelog/) although the change log can lag the nightly substantially.

If you want a stable production release, you can always find the latest stable release at [the Surge Website](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io)

In addition to these nightlies, we generate nightlies for a variety of flavors of Linux using [OpenBuildService](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Asurge-synth-team&package=surge-xt-nightly)
