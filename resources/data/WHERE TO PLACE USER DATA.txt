At startup, Surge scans for all information (skins, patches, wavetables, etc...) from both the factory folder and the user folder.
The factory folder is installed in an admin-writable central location, while the user folder is in your user documents area.
The locations are outlined in the manual, but you can always find your user folder with "Menu > Data Folders > Open User Data Folder"

If you put user content in the factory folder or otherwise change it, future installers will erase it. Our installers
never touch anything in the user area.

So, if you want to install a custom skin, set of patches, or otherwise add things to Surge, put them in your user data folder instead of here,
or risk losing them when you upgrade.

For more information, please consult the manual.

Thank you!
