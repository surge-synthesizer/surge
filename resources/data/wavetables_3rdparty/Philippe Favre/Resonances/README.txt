RESONANCE WAVETABLES

These are short Wavetables (16 shapes max) in which each shape has been sampled at the pitch it should be reproduced at in Surge.
These resonances were captured from the output of a multiband filter, sampled every major third on a 5 octave keyboard (C-E-G#...).
The intention is to distribute the shapes of the wavetable on a 5 octave keyboard (MIDI notes 36-96).
For this, you should set the Keytrack modulator to modulate Morphing by 21%, and Keytrack Root parameter to MIDI note 36
(C2 in case of the default Middle C display setting, C4 - or right-click Keytrack Root, Edit Value and type in 36).
