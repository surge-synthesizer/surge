Hiding a control is remarkably easy. Just find a control and give it class "none". This works
for sliders, switches, and also for special types and panels. If for a panel you set a class
'none' it pushes to the children of the panel, effectively hiding the entire group.

This example simply hides the LFO deform and amplitude sliders, the oscillator display, and the
entire mixer section. That's not a very useful skin practically, but combined with the move
and resize examples shown in other tutorials, it gives an idea of how to generate 'compact' or
'player' skins.

    Here we hide a couple of sliders. We could do the same with switches and so on, of course.
    [doc]-->
    <control ui_identifier="lfo.deform" class="none"/>
    <control ui_identifier="lfo.amplitude" class="none"/>
    <control ui_identifier="filter.cutoff_2" class="none"/>

    <!--[doc]
    But you can also hide more special non-slider controls. Here's the osc.display being hidden.
    [doc]-->
    <control ui_identifier="osc.display" class="none"/>

    <!--[doc]
    Finally, the skin model places items into groups, and so assigning a class of 'none' to a group
    hides all the components inside it.
    [doc]-->
    <control ui_identifier="mix.panel" class="none"/>

    <control ui_identifier="lfo.title" class="none"/>
  </controls>
