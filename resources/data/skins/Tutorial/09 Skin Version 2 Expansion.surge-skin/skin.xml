<!--[doc]
In Surge 1.9 (released spring 2021) we added a variety of features to the skin engine. These are activated
by setting skin version = "2", and this skin demonstrates them. *If you are reading this documentation building
a skin vor Surge 1.8 or have your skin version set to "1" these features will not work.

Also: This tutorial is not copmlete as of Feb 15 2021. Work in progress.

     I know its annoying but to give the filter 2 enough space we need to move the f2 cutoff and res.
     for now I just turn them off since this is a demo skin

    <control ui_identifier="filter.cutoff_2" class="none"/>
    <control ui_identifier="filter.resonance_2" class="none"/>

    Version 9 fixed a problem with groups where making a group would blow up subsequent group move.
    The below would fail in skin version 1 / surge 1.8
    [doc]-->
    <group x="306" y="212">
      <control ui_identifier="filter.cutoff_1" x="0" y="0"/>
      <control ui_identifier="filter.resonance_1" x="10" y="26"/>
    </group>

    <!--[doc]
    Similarly version 9 resets default positions for controls in user defined groups to 0,0.
    Lets use this to purposefully mis-position a few things
    [doc]-->
    <group x="3" y="17">
      <control ui_identifier="global.active_scene"/> <!-- should be at 3,17 -->
      <control ui_identifier="global.scene_mode" y="10"/> <!-- should be at 3,27 -->
      <control ui_identifier="scene.polylimit" x="15"/> <!-- should be at 3,23 -->
    </group>

    <control ui_identifier="mixer.panel" x="170" y="280"/>
