 The Surge Skin Engine allows designers control over the positioning, rendering, and in some more limited cases
 action of components which make up the Surge UI. These tutorials comprise the documentation for the skin engine
 at this time.

 The basic structure of a surge skin is a directory named "Something.surge-skin" which contains at least a single
 file "skin.xml" describing the contents of the skin directory and the desired behaviour of the resulting surge UI.
 We call a ".surge-skin" directory and its contents a "skin", "skin bundle" or "bundle" interchangably.

 The skin bundle can be placed either in the user's surge documents directory (the location where user patches
 are saved, as shown by the 'show user folder' menu item) or in the Surge central data folder if it is a
 skin distributed with Surge.  Surge will search recursively for skins through both the factory and
 user data areas.

 The "skin.xml" file contains 4 key items
 * The `surge-skin` tag with core attributes describing the skin
 * The `globals` section defining global variables such as image directories and colors
 * The `component classes` section, defining user-defined classes for components
 * The `controls` section, which lays out the controls that build the UI

 Surge compiles the Classic User Interface, including the images, control type, and layout
 information, into the Surge DLL. As such, the `skin.xml` file is overriding or modifying parts
 of the default layout. While you can change every element of the UI, you can also choose to change
 nothing at all, and you will get the simplest built in version of the Surge Classic UI.

 So this is the simplest "skin.xml" file. It defines a `surge-skin` with a name, category, author, authorURL
 and version (which as of this writing must be "1"), and then declares empty globals, component-classes, and controls
 sections.

 It is worth noting that the Surge default skin is actually a bit larger than this file. Since the skin engine
 activates features like hover overlays for some controls, the `default.surge-skin` surge uses a couple of features
 shared in later tutorials. If you load this skin, you will get a UI with correct layout and functionality but no hover
 images (some built in controls will display hover; more on that later).
