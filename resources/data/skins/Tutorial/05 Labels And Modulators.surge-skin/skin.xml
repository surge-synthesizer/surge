Surge skins to date have rendered the labels in SVGs as paths. Surge does install the Lato font with
an installation, though, and in Surge 1.8, you can use that font to draw labels anywhere on the UI.
This would allow you, in theory, to have text-free graphical assets for the background and render
labels as strings. Button assets would still require text-in-SVGs for now.

In Surge 1.8, there is minimal control over the positiong of the modulation section in the UI.
You can adjust the x and y position of the entire panel, or the color of an individual element
using the mechanism described in Tutorial 02 and 03 and the labels from the skin inspector.
In Surge 1.9, we expect to expand the ability to reponsition modulation source controls.

    Adding a label is simple, though. Simply add a label control at a position with text and properties. Here is a full example
    [doc]-->
    <label x="10" y="30" w="150" h="30" font-size="24" font-style="bold" color="#004400" bg-color="#AAFFAA488" frame-color="#FFFFFF" text="I Am Green"/>
  </controls>
