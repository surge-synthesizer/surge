Changing layout is a critical feature of the skin engine. If you run the skin inspector you can see
that each control has been advertised with a name and has a location. Some controls are grouped in
panels by default, allowing you to move groups of items.

Moving an item in the skin engine is as simple as finding its ID and then re-setting the X and Y
location in the skin XML document. We show a few examples here.

    The first most simple example is to just move a single slider. In the 18 UI the filter balance control
    is positioned in the middle of a block. Lets move it. In the skin inspector in classic we see that
    the control `filter.balance` has location `456x224`. Lets move it 10 pixels

    <control ui_identifier="filter.balance" x="446" y="214"/>

    <!--[doc]
    The skin inspector also shows that some items are in parent groups. For instance, the oscillator parameters
    are all parented in a component named `osc.param.panel`. You should be able to see this in the Skin Inspector.

    This means we can relocate all the parameters at once. Here we're just going to give them a little jump
    to the right.
