Adding Fonts is under active development. Currently it only works on a limited set of controls and only
on macOS. We will update this as that changes.

Controls take a font-family name as an argument generally. (As of this writing, only sliders do!). That
font-family sets the font family and so if there is a widely used font, like, say, comic-sans, you can choose
that and the system font resolution will resolve the family name.

If you want to add custom fonts and have appropriate license to distribute the ttf files, you can create a
subdirectory of your skin called "fonts" which contains ttf files, and Surge will make those families available to
you. This skin demonstrates that.

This is clearly a work in progress and the design and specifications be updated as we approach 1.8.0. Please don't use
it yet unless you are working with the dev team.
