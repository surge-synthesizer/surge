One of the basic features of a skin file is to allow you to change images and colors in the skin preserving layouts.
There's a variety of ways to do this which are covered in the tutorials, depending whether you want to do it
system wide or on a per-control basis. This second tutorail covers the simple replacement of global colors
and images, which results in a simple 're-skin' of the default surge skin with identical placement, size, and
behavior of all controls.
