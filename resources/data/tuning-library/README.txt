This is a collection of SCL and KBM files provided by Surge Contributor Jacky Ligon
as we were developing and testing the SCL/KBM implementation around the 1.6.5 release.
It contains a variety of tuning and mapping files for your enjoyment.

To apply a tuning or mapping, either load them with the "tuning" menu or drag and drop
an .scl or .kbm file onto the "tun" glyph next to the patch menu bar.

There are many more SCL files available on the internet, as well as a variety of tools
to edit and make scales. If you are reading this you probably already know that of course,
but http://www.huygens-fokker.org/ is a great resource.

Enjoy!
