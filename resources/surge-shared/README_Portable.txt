The Surge XT Windows Portable Distribution

The Surge XT Portable Zip bundles the assets, vst3, clap, and exe into a single directory which is set up
so all assets are self contained. If you re-organize the directory structure, your system may not work
without manual creation of hard links. Please consult the surge manual.

The VST3 spec does not allow installs of VST3 outside prescribed locations. Some DAWs allow this nonetheless,
but FL does not. If you are a FL user, do not use this, but rather use our standard installer.
