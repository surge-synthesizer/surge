This directory contains the GUI assets. Directory layout is as follows

1: Each 'skin' is a directory
2: That directory contains a subdirectory called 'master' and one called 'exported'
3: In 'master' keep whatever assets and formats you want
4: In 'exported' you should have four sub-directories named scale_DDD where
   DDD is "100", "150", "200", and "300" for scales from the original sizing 
   where the assets map to the name of the v1.6 bitmaps in "../resources/bitmaps"

take a look at the "original" skin for the basic idea.
