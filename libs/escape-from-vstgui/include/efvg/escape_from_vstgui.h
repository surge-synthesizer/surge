 * here *please please* chat with @baconpaul in the #surge-development channel on discord or
 * check the pinned 'status' issue on the surge github. This code has all sorts of problems
 * (dependencies out of order, memory leaks, etc...) which I'm working through as I bootstrap
 * our way out of vstgui.
